::: section introduction

I'm a software engineer who is commited to learning and improving their craft. 
From a young age I have been passionate about all things related to technology and software and as I have grown so has my passion.

In my younger years I wanted to make Games. And after I finished secondary school I went on to do a course in Video Games development. During this time I realised that I had more interest in making software than games. So decided to get my degree in Computer Science.

Later I've worked full time in the e-learning industry making single page applications on demand for a variety of clients and more recently I work for 888sport where I am being given many opertunities to work with many newer web technologies.

From 2017 to 2019 I lived in Japan where I studied Japanese and was able to pass the Japanese-Language Proficiency Test at an N3 level.
