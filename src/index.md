::: section introduction

I'm an engineering team lead and software developer with over a decade of experience building high-quality web applications. 

From a young age I have been passionate about all things related to technology and software, and as I've grown, so has my enthusiasm for empowering others through great tooling and automation.

In my younger years I wanted to make games. After finishing secondary school I completed a course in video game development. During this time I realised I had more interest in making software than games, and later earned a degree in Computer Science.

My professional background spans e-learning, SaaS, and sports betting platforms. I’ve built internal tooling for instructional designers, helped launch CMSs and frontend apps for high-traffic betting sites, and worked across the stack using technologies like React, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Docker, and AWS Lambda. I place strong focus on accessibility, clean code, and developer experience.

In October 2017 I enrolled as a full-time student for 18 months at GenkiJACS in Fukuoka to improve my Japanese. While there I passed the JLPT N3.

I enjoy programming and learning new technologies. I regularly build small tools and automations to make work more efficient or to try out something new.

More recently, I've taken an interest in AI and natural language interfaces and how they can help users and teams work more effectively.

Currently I work as Engineering Team Lead at iheed, an e-learning company that trains doctors and nurses.
